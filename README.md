#### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

I didn't think to make this file before starting the project, but it would have been a good place to reflect on it. This particular project didn't take a huge amount of time, but I did experience some snags along the way that were worth documenting. I kept track of these things in my personal daily journal, [seen here](https://github.com/GrinninBarrett/markdown-journals/blob/master/programming/august/08-07-2020.md). That's a private repository for now but I may make it public in the future. The biggest problem I had was implementing functions with proper scope in mind. It turns out I needed a couple of the smaller functions to be within the bigger one (<code>playRound()</code>) in order for them to be called each time the <code>playRound()</code> function was called by the <code>game()</code> function. I think I learned some valuable fundamentals during this project that will hopefully become automatic actions for me over time.
